  Hi, my name's Sam and I’m working as a backend software engineer at Sky, building Scala microservices for content discovery recommenders. The tech I’m primarily working with at the moment is: <mark>Scala</mark>, <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>Kafka</mark> and <mark>Cassandra</mark>.
  
  I am a firm believer in utilizing technology as a powerful catalyst for fostering positive social change. Currently, my focus lies in honing my technical skills and expanding my knowledge. With a solid foundation in software engineering across various layers of the technology stack, I am well-equipped to contribute to the ongoing transformation of the industry.

  
  My most recent personal projects include a BeautifulSoup powered web-scraping price checker / notifier and an upcoming privacy focused anti-stylometry library.

          I started this project to learn more about web scraping with Python and BeautifulSoupwhile also getting some experience with the Python packaging ecosystem... and perhaps to find a few bargains in the process.
          
          It has good test coverage with <mark>pytest</mark>. Typed and checked with <mark>mypy</mark>. All code is concisely documented with Google style docstrings.
          
          It's doesn't feel as good to make something people won't use, so I put a fair amount of time into the readme and installation flow.

          Privacy is an increasingly urgent concern with worrying implications for society[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.socialcooling.com/). Thankfully, awareness is growing and more people are taking steps to preserve their digital privacy as evidenced by the rising popularity of VPN software or the introduction of the recent GDPR regulations.
          
          This project is a response to the apparent scarcity of actively developed tools aimed at protecting against an individual's writing style betraying their identity.
          
          "The loss of an expectation of privacy can result in a chilling effect where individuals are too afraid to draw attention to a problem, because they fear being discovered and punished for their actions." -- Kacmarcik, G., & Gamon, M. (2006, July)

          During my time studying psychology at Portsmouth I spent a lot of time analysing humans and quantifying their behaviours for statistical analysis, gaining useful insights on how people interact with systems. Usability of software systems is particularly critical considering how tightly integrated humans and software are in modern life.
          
          My dissertation was a study exploring differences in communication efficiency between face-to-face and virtual (think webcam-to-webcam meetings) information sharing.
