about_content: |
  Hello, I'm Sam, a backend software engineer at Sky specialising in scalable <mark>Scala</mark> microservices for content discovery recommenders. I work across multiple streaming platforms, notably Peacock. My current tech stack includes <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>Kafka</mark>, <mark>Cassandra</mark>, and [<mark>Cats Effect</mark>](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).
  
  I thrive on applying technology to crack complex problems that spark positive change. I'm always keen to push the boundaries of my technical expertise, hunting for elegant solutions to real-world puzzles.

  When I'm not wrangling code, I'm usually tinkering away on some personal project. Right now, I'm developing SugarSentry, an ESP32-based ambient blood glucose visualisation device for my fiancée. It's my way of hacking her (extremely demanding) diabetes management, if even just a little.

        description: |
          My psychology studies at Portsmouth honed my skills in analysing human behaviour and quantifying interactions, providing valuable insights into how people engage with systems. This understanding is crucial in today's software-integrated world, where usability is paramount.
          
          My dissertation explored the efficiency of information sharing in face-to-face versus virtual (webcam-to-webcam) communication, a topic that has become increasingly relevant in our digital age.
