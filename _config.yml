about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Hello, I'm Sam, a backend software engineer at Sky. I specialise in building scalable <mark>Scala</mark> microservices for content discovery recommenders. My current tech stack includes <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>Kafka</mark>, <mark>Cassandra</mark>, and [<mark>Cats Effect</mark>](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).
  
  I'm passionate about leveraging technology to drive positive social change and solve real-world problems. I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of my technical expertise, always seeking to apply cutting-edge solutions to complex issues.

  Outside of work, I enjoy tackling meaningful personal projects. I'm currently developing SugarSentry, an ESP32-based portable blood glucose monitor for my fiancée, who has Type 1 diabetes.
