  Backend software engineer at Sky (NBCU) specialising in functional Scala ([Typelevel](https://typelevel.org/)). Building and operating high-throughput microservices on Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) for content discovery/recommendations across Peacock and other Sky/NBCU streaming platforms, with Kafka event streaming and Cassandra persistence. Strong focus on performance tuning, observability, and distributed systems.

  Current side project: [SugarSentry](https://github.com/sam0jones0/SugarSentry) - an ESP32-based IoT device for real-time blood glucose visualisation.

  London, UK. Right to work in the UK.

          - Service owner for a core orchestration service assembling recommendation rails across Peacock, Sky TV and Showmax; accountable for SLOs (uptime/error/latency) and live-event on-call operations
          - Reduced per-page entity filtering/business-logic p99 from 50ms → 10ms while processing ~1M entities/page by profiling with JFR/JMC and removing allocation hotspots (lower GC pressure)
          - Improved end-to-end page assembly/orchestration p99 from 300ms @ 50 pages/sec/pod to 250ms @ 100 pages/sec/pod by heap tuning and bounded thread pools after saturating downstream HTTP/2 calls to ML recommenders
          - Parallelised + batched rail assembly so 100 rails adds <10ms vs single-rail requests
          - Implemented progressive delivery with Argo Rollouts (canary/blue-green)

          - Migrated production services from Akka to Typelevel (Cats Effect, FS2, Tapir), improving change lead time and long-term maintainability
          - Implemented OpenTelemetry tracing (otel4s) to improve incident triage across service boundaries and protect SLOs
          - Operated multi-region Kubernetes deployments (EKS/GKE) and configured Istio traffic policies (timeouts, retries, outlier detection)
          - Supported [peak live-event traffic](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/article/peacock-continues-growth-after-nfl-wild-card-game-success) across Peacock, Sky TV, Showmax (performance + on-call)
